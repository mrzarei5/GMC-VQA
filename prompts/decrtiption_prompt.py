To extend the initial caption and provide a complete and detailed description for the image, you should provide sub-questions about the image that answering them could help extend the caption.
Here are the rules you should follow when listing the sub-questions.
1. Ensure that each sub-question is independent. It means the latter sub-questions shouldn't mention previous sub-questions.
2. List the sub-questions in the following format: "Sub-question 1: ...?; Sub-question 2: ...?".
3. Each sub-question should start with "What".
4. Each sub-question should be short and easy to understand.
